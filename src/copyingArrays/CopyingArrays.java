	 * Create a new Java class called ArrayCopier

	 * arrays of integers as parameters. The method 
	 * should copy the elements of the first array 
	 * (you can call it src, from ÒsourceÓ) to the second
	 * one (dst, from ÒdestinationÓ) as much as possible.
	 * If the second array is smaller, then only 
	 * those elements that fit will be copied. 
	 * If the second array is larger, it will be 
	 * filled with zeroes. Write a program that creates 
	 * an object of this class and uses this method to 
	 * copy some arrays in all three cases:
	 * 
	 * >> Both arrays are of the same size.
	 * >> The source array is longer.
	 * >> The source array is shorter.
